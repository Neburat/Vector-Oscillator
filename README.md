# Vector-Oscillator

VectorOsc~ can object generate periodic waveforms. VectorOsc~ can continuously interpolate between 4 different waveforms: sine, triangular,  square and sawtooth.
The object offer also a basic frequency modulation implementation, with the changing wave as carrier and a user selected wave between sine, triangular and sawtooth as a modulator.
